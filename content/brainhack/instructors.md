We are happy to join the Brainhack School Taiwan hub this year and we will actively work with the Taiwan hub to kick off the program. We will conduct our course in parallel to the Taiwan local hub, and we plan to have an in-person exchange visit to Taiwan for the final week round of research presentations and symposium.

## The BrainHack School Taiwan Team

Neuroscience is a thriving field that is constantly advancing, with new methodologies and innovative analyses that continuously renew our understanding of the human brain. In order to keep up with the latest cutting-edge analytical techniques, demanding workshops are necessary for learning and practice. [Brainhack School](https://school-brainhack.github.io/), which originated at the University of Montreal, unites interdisciplinary researchers from various countries and campuses to organize an intensive program that helps people learn through project-based practice. Brainhack School Taiwan joined the international consortium in 2023, which brought together experts from National Central University and National Taiwan University to team up with Brainhack Schools around the world.


### Taiwan Directors

 ![jpg](/brainhack/pfp/OSGoh.jpg)
**Dr Joshua O.S. Goh**
- Role: Associate Professor
- Affiliation: Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taiwan
- E-mail: joshuagoh at ntu.edu.tw
 
Josh focuses on understanding intelligence functions in the brain and the biological and experiential constraints. 

His methodological approaches involve cognitive experiments, brain imaging, and formal modeling with considerations of age and cultural differences, as well as artificial intelligence operations 

 ![jpg](/brainhack/pfp/Chia-Lin.jpg)
**Dr Chia-Lin Charlene Lee**
- Role: Associate Professor
- Affiliation: Graduate Institute of Linguistics, National Taiwan University, Taiwan
- E-mail: chialinlee at ntu.edu.tw
 
Charlene focuses on semantic and syntactic language processing in the brain as well as contextual influences such as sentence constraints and emotional information. 

Her primary experimental approach uses electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potentials (ERP) applied on younger to older adults.

Chun-Hsien utilizes electronencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying language comprehension. 

His research focuses on how brain activity relates to abstract representations of human language, including empty categories in syntactic structures and morpho-syntactic features. Additionally, he explores how these linguistic representations are acquired in both children and second-language learners.
