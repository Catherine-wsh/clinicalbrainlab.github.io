## Brainhack School NTU

Neuroscience is a thriving field that is constantly advancing, with new methodologies and innovative analyses that continuously renew our understanding of the human brain. In order to keep up with the latest cutting-edge analytical techniques, demanding workshops are necessary for learning and practice. The Brainhack School, which originated at the University of Montreal, unites interdisciplinary researchers from various countries and campuses to organize an intensive program that helps people learn through project-based practice.
