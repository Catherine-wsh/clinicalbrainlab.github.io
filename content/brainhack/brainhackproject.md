This is wrap-ups from [Brainhack school offical website](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project_guide/)

## Goals
We expect each participants have different data analysis experience and distinct interests. Some participants without experience on brain data would like to learn baisc brain data analysis, but others might seek for advanced analystic techinique that will be beneficial to their research. No matter what the experience you have, your project should contain the new skills you have never learned. You should intensively implement your project in the 4-weeks Brainhack school and acquire these new skills. TAs will help you to build up the project that fit your needs. In the end of course, you should have **two major outcomes** for a project:
1. Submit your project codes, website report, and slides on a Github repository. (The website report can be easily achieved by [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)).
2. Video recorded presentation

**Note:**
Looking for example of project? You can find that from the past Brainhack School [here](https://school-brainhack.github.io/project/).
