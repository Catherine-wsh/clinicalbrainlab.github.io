**BrainHack School NTU**

This course focuses on advanced data preprocessing and analytical techniques for human brain neurophysiological data including electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The course will be conducted in conjunction with 4-weeks long BrainHack School (2025/03/24 - 2025/06/20). We will use a format that combines self-paced modules learning with pre-made tutorial and project-based practice with Teaching Assistant (TA) advising. Course students will explore relevant topics in interaction with TAs from various backgrounds in order to conduct a practical project.
 
Student project topics will be determined jointly with the TAs who will provide advice on what are feasible/meaningful goals. We are highly flexible on project topics as long as they are geared to either let students learn new techniques or to complete a real scientific research analysis of extant data within the course time frame. Students will need to submit a project report in the form of a webpage and a recorded video presentation, which will be the basis of the course grade.
