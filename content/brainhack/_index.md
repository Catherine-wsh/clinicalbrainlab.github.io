# BrainHack School NTU
## Overview
This course focuses on advanced data preprocessing and analytical techniques for human brain neurophysiological data including electroencephalography/event-related potentials (EEG/ERP), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and structural/functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 

## Learning Format
The course is conducted with the international [BrainHack School](https://school-brainhack.github.io/). We combine *self-paced module learning with tutorials* and *project-based practical work* under Teaching Assistant (TA) advising over two phases during the semester.

### Preparation Phase (Mid-March to early May)
Singapore students in the BrainHack School Singapore NTU (BHS-SG-NTU) hub will do self-paced module learning with primary advising by local TAs.

### International Phase (May to June)
We will join with the BHS international hub. Students submit weekly module tutorials to the local hub courses. In addition, students propose, work on, and submit progress reports on their own practical projects, *working collaboratively with students and TAs from local or other hubs*. The final week will be a mini-symposium for students to share their research findings. There will also be talks by faculty and other professionals as schedule permits.

## Teaching platforms
We will use [Discord](https://discord.com/) as the main communication platform for posting announcements, raising questions, sharing resources, networking, and comments on tutorials and projects. For Taiwan, we will primarily use the [BrainHack.School.Singapore](https://discord.gg/bEaZwawa), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/GaDpYkqNzJ) before and after the Brainhack school. During the **International Phase**, we will shift primary engagement to the **international Discord server** (link provided later in course) to foster collaborative work.

## Course Requirement
* Personal computer with installed softwares as needed for your own project.
* You will also need [Discord](https://discord.com/), and a [Github](https://github.com/) account to submit your project final product as a Github repository. See [Technical help](https://www.clinicalbrain.org/brainhack/technicalhelp/).
* Backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience and coding are optional but very strongly recommended. 
* A strong motivational capacity for self-learning, question-generation, and problem-solving for your own project.
