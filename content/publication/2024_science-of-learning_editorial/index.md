abstract: "The Science of Learning, “the scientific study of the underlying bases
of learning with the goal of describing, understanding, or improving
learning across developmental stages and diverse contexts”, has
continued to garner considerable interest from researchers, policymakers,
and members of the general community. While interest in this
area is not limited to any one discipline, educational researchers and
practitioners likely constitute the most significant driving force. In
collaboration with other experts from fields as diverse as psychology,
neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and sociology, researchers in the
Science of Learning have leveraged innovative methodologies to investigate
the complexities of how individuals acquire, retain, and apply
knowledge. This cross-disciplinary approach has led to groundbreaking
discoveries such as the brain networks underlying reading and
mathematical thinking, the association between executive
function and academic performance, and the impact of
socio-cultural factors on learning. Such cross-disciplinary efforts
have been crucial in developing both a deeper understanding of
how learning occurs and factors underlying observed differences in this
complex ability."
