abstract: "Interacting with complex and dynamic environments challenges the brain’s ability to adapt to change. This key ability known as cognitive flexibility involves learning the structure of the environment, switching attention between features, dimensions and tasks, and adopting new rules in the face of uncertainty. Training cognitive flexibility has strong potential to improve adaptive behavior across the lifespan with impact in real-world settings (e.g. educational, clinical). Here, we review evidence on the role of cognitive training in improving executive functions and the factors that may enhance the effectiveness of training programs. We propose that personalized and adaptive training programs that focus on the multifaceted abilities comprising cognitive flexibility are key for promoting adaptive behavior and lifelong learning in real-world settings."
