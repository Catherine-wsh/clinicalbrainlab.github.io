abstract: "Hierarchical causal relations underlie state changes in dynamic environments. These relations could beencoded in the brain hierarchically and optimal inference occurs via Bayesian estimation of the context ofincoming sensory evidence. The neural correlates of Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) and theirchanges across age are not well elucidated. Thus, we examined the neural encoding of HBI across age groups in a probabilistic task during an EEG recording."
