abstract: "Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) has been shown to modulate cortical inhibition and excitability, with previous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies altered responses in older adults. The combination of TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) provides an opportunity to directly examine the local cortical mechanisms underpinning TMS and could characterize the neurophysiologic substrate of cTBS-induced plasticity. This study aimed to examine the underlying physiological mechanisms of cTBS-induced modulation of cortico-spinal excitability and intracortical inhibition using TMS-EEG in older and younger adults."
