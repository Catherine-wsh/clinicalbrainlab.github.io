Bio: I obtained my PhD in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIITDM Jabalpur, India in 2017 on thesis titled “Development of affine video stabilization techniques using integral projects under challenging scenic conditions”. After my PhD, I served as Research Scientist at the National Brain Research Centre, Manesar, India (2016-2020), where I worked on identifying novel brain metabolic and imaging biomarkers using MRI/MRS for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Most recently, I served as a Magnetic Resonance Physicist at Imperial College London (2021-2022) and one of its research sites at Perinatal Trial Unit foundation in Bangalore, India (2020-2021), where I was involved in diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy data processing and analysis to identify diagnostic marker for HIE neonates undergoing cooling therapy after birth.

I joined the CLIC team on 6th April 2023 as a Research Fellow in CLIC’s Neuroimaging workgroup under Prof Annabel Chen Shen-Hsing. I am currently overseeing data quality checks, developing processing and analysis pipelines for neuroimaging data.
