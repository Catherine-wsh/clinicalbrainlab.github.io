Masato has been interested in how physical activity affects physical and psychological well-being and human development. 
In the quest to find answers to that question, he has conducted extensive research on the optimal experience in physical activity settings. 
As an educator, he has been most interested in how practitioners (e.g., educators and coaches) can assist others in engaging constructively so that they can lead flourishing lives. 
He has used physical activity (e.g., exercise and sport) as a vehicle for fostering the principles of personal growth.

His research outputs have been published in respectable international journals (e.g., Psychology of Sport and Exercise, Journal of Sports Sciences, Motivation and Emotion). 
The study by Mallett, Kawabata, Newcombe, Forero and Jackson (2007) was ranked first in the top-25 ‘hottest’ articles (most downloaded) of PSE, October-December 2007. 
During his candidacy for the PhD, he was awarded by The University of Queensland a postgraduate research scholarship and three research grants for his doctoral research. 
Furthermore, he was identified by the 1st-year UQ HMS students as an outstanding tutor for 2008.
