Elias Ebrahimzadeh was born in Tehran in 1984. He received the B.Sc. Degree in Electronic Engineering in 2008, Tehran, and the M.Sc. Degree in Biomedical Engineering, Tehran, in 2011.  He succeeded in being Ranked 1st Admitted Ph.D. of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Tehran, Iran in 2014 and received his Ph.D. degree, in 2019. During his Ph.D., his primary focus was on the localization of the epileptic foci using simultaneous EEG-fMRI recording in patients with epilepsy. Specifically, he developed a novel approach based on the ICA theory for this purpose. To enhance his knowledge and experience and get ready to accomplish high-quality research, he joined a research team at the University of Calgary, Canada, working on the same field as his Ph.D. thesis for his sabbatical as a scholar Ph.D. researcher. He also has a keen interest in research and education involving neurosciences, biomedical signal and image processing, artificial neural networks, statistical pattern recognition, system identification, bio electromagnetic, and machine learning. Since he was fond of the interplay of these sciences towards the study of the brain after his Ph.D., he received a fully funded postdoctoral position at the Oakland University, Detroit, Michigan from the US in the field of NMR. Then, as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, he joined CLICâ€™s Neuroimaging workgroup hosted by the CARES in Jun 2022. This project was a collaboration between Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore and the University of Cambridge, England. Dr. Elias Ebrahimzadeh is currently working in the Neuroimaging Laboratory, School of Cognitive Sciences, Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences (IPM), Tehran, Iran as a postdoctoral research fellow and an Assistant Prof. applying multimodal techniques in the fields of Neuroscience and Neurophysics. During this postdoc training, he has experience in designing and conducting simultaneous EEG-fMRI data acquisition during a cognitive task and is familiar with its applications to patients with epilepsy. He has authored or co-authored more than 60 publications in international journals.
