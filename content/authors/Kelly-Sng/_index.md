Kelly is interested in how neurophysiological techniques such as fMRI can be employed to uncover the neural mechanisms in social interactions and relationships.
She is keen in exploring the multiculturalism context in Singapore, and how that affects the traditional conception of self, identity, and intergroup relations.
