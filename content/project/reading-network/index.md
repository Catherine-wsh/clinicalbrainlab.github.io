Our projects aim to elucidate the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying typical and impaired reading in bilinguals. 
We use a combination of behavioural assessment and neuroimaging techniques to investigate the neural reading networks for bilingual readers from a variety of language profiles, across early childhood and adulthood. 
Our projects will shed light on the impact of critical factors (e.g., orthographic depth of scripts, auditory perception skills) on the bilingual reading networks. Our findings will provide implications for neuroscience-informed remediation of reading difficulties for bilingual readers.

<u>Completed Projects:</u> 
1.	Effective Biliteracy: The Impact of Script Sets on Bilingual Reading Networks for Typical and Atypical Readers - *funded by NTU-JHU Collaborative Grant*
2.  Modulating Reading Networks -*funded by NTU-JHU Collaborative Grant*
3.	Cognitive Science of Multilingualism In Children (COSMIC) - *funded by National Research Foundation*
