Cerebellum has increasingly been recognized for its contributions beyond motor control to higher cognitive functions. Our work focuses on the roles of cerebellum in language. We use neuroimaging techniques to examine the cerebellar involvement and the cerebro-cerebellar contributions towards language and reading-related processes.

The findings highlight the role of the cerebellum in reading networks. The implications underscore the need for further research on heterogeneity of cerebellar functions and cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity to develop a comprehensive understanding of the neural correlates of reading.
